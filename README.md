This is a basic 3 column framework built on sass. It's purpose is to reduce
the technical cost of CSS by removing the imposed duplication. 

By editing a few basic settings, this framework can be configured into various dimensions
and colour schemes using the default variables set in framework.scss.

This framework makes use of multiple inheritance through Sass mixins.

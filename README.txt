CSS Framework
===========================

Authored my @rimian under GPL. Enjoy!

This is a basic 3 column framework built on sass. It's purpose is to reduce
the technical cost of CSS by removing the imposed duplication. 

By editing a few basic settings, this framework can be configured into various dimensions
and colour schemes using the default variables set in framework.scss.

Sass
----------------------

Sass is a ruby gem. It extends CSS to include variables, mixins and nested CSS.
This framework makes use of multiple inheritance through Sass mixins.
